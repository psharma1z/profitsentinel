0.18|Low-Medium Risk|1461974400000|Monitoring needed|The customer demonstrates a generally stable financial profile with a low revolving balance, no delinquencies, and a consistent FICO score around 700-720. However, there are notable deviations that warrant monitoring. The most significant deviation occurred in May 2016 (Snapshot Month: 1461974400000), where the ECL MoM Charge increased drastically by 147.48, and the cumulative profit decreased by 0.3%. This month also saw a significant spike in Total Debt, which increased to $282,988. This deviation suggests a potential risk that could escalate if not monitored closely. The probability of default is calculated at 18%, placing the customer in the Low-Medium Risk category. The primary factors contributing to this risk level include the high ECL MoM change, increased debt levels, and a slight decrease in FICO score. Recommendations include close monitoring of the customer's financial behavior, particularly focusing on any further increases in debt or ECL charges. If similar deviations are observed i|Customer A
0.85|Very High Risk|1498780800000|Intervention needed|The customer exhibits a very high risk of default, with a probability of default calculated at 85%. This is driven by several key factors: a significant increase in delinquency from 0 to 7 over the period, a high and increasing utilization rate peaking at 96.9%, and a declining FICO score from 689 to 665. The total debt and debt-to-income ratio have also escalated dramatically, indicating financial distress. The earliest month triggering intervention is June 2017 (1498780800000), where the cumulative profit turned significantly negative, driven by a sharp increase in ECL charges. The customer’s financial behavior deviates significantly from expected norms, with multiple indicators suggesting a deteriorating financial situation. Immediate intervention is recommended to mitigate further risk and potential losses. Monitoring alone is insufficient given the rapid decline in financial health and the high probability of default. The bank should consider contacting the customer to discuss potential solutions, such as restructuring debt or offering financial counseling, to prevent further deterioratio|Customer B
0.85|Very High Risk|1625011200000|Intervention needed|The customer exhibits a very high risk of default, with a probability of default calculated at 85%. This is primarily driven by significant negative changes in key financial indicators. The earliest month triggering intervention is June 2021, where the MoM Cumulative Profit turned negative due to a substantial increase in ECL MoM Charge and delinquency. The customer's FICO score has been declining, and there has been a marked increase in utilization and total debt, indicating financial distress. The debt-to-income ratio has also increased significantly, further exacerbating the risk. The customer has multiple credit inquiries and delinquencies, which are strong indicators of financial instability. Immediate intervention is recommended to mitigate potential losses and provide support to the customer in managing their financial obligations. Monitoring should continue to assess the effectiveness of the intervention and adjust strategies as needed|Customer C
0.75|High Risk|1661904000000|Intervention needed|The customer’s financial risk has escalated significantly over the observed period. Initially, the customer maintained a low revolving balance and zero delinquency, leading to a steady increase in cumulative profit. However, starting from month 33 (timestamp 1661904000000), there was a notable increase in revolving balance and delinquency, which coincided with a sharp decline in cumulative profit. The customer’s FICO score also dropped from 740 to 682, indicating deteriorating creditworthiness. The ECL MoM Charge saw significant spikes, particularly in months 34 and 36, suggesting increased expected credit losses. Utilization rates also increased, peaking at 40.76%. Given these indicators, the probability of default is calculated at 75%, placing the customer in the high-risk category. The earliest month triggering intervention is month 33, where cumulative profit first turned negative. Immediate intervention is recommended to mitigate further financial deterioration. Monitoring alone may not suffice due to the rapid escalation in risk factors. Th|Customer D
0.45|Medium Risk|1711843200000|Intervention needed|"The customer initially exhibited stable financial behavior with a high FICO score of 760, zero delinquency, and consistent debt-to-income ratio. However, significant deviations began in the 38th month, marked by a drastic change in income category from ""$120K +"" to ""Less than $40K"" and a sharp increase in revolving balance. This led to a substantial rise in utilization and a decrease in FICO score, indicating increased financial stress. The ECL MoM Charge spiked dramatically, particularly in the 40th month, causing a significant drop in cumulative profit. The probability of default is calculated at 45%, placing the customer in the Medium Risk category. The earliest month triggering intervention is the 40th month, where the cumulative profit dropped significantly due to a high ECL charge. Immediate intervention is recommended to address the underlying financial issues and prevent further deterioration. Monitoring should focus on stabilizing the revolving balance, improving the FICO score, and managing the debt-to-income ratio to mitigat"|Customer E
